<details><summary><b>How does it work?</b></summary>

Crime pre-defines nicknames and ids for a collection of Socrata datasets [like this one](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.edd.ca.gov/nt76-4rha) for you to pick from. This info isn't stored in the package itself, but rather in [this json file](https://github.com/ryayoung/crime/blob/main/colorado-crime-datasets-doc.json) on Github, which can be updated anytime without changing the code. Every time you import `crime`, a Github API request is made to retrieve this configuration, so you'll need internet. Calling `cr.sources()` without parameters will just return this info, without making any additional requests.

In addition to letting you load/preview any of these datasets, `crime`'s most important feature is its ability to show a detailed description on each dataset, with full documentation on every column. When you run `cr.sources('dataset_name')`, an api request is made to Socrata to get the metadata on a particular dataset. The most useful information gets formatted & printed to your screen. [Here](https://github.com/ryayoung/crime/blob/main/all_data_info.txt) is what that output would look like if you looped through each dataset name and printed its description.

**Caching:** Any dataset you load fully will get stored in memory. So next time you request it within the same Jupyter notebook session, it will be available immediately.

# Getting Started

<!-- #### First, [get an App Token](#getting_token) from Socrata. Not required but highly recommended.  -->

<!-- # -->

> Use `cr.help()` for a quick intro.

#

Let's look at the crime data available

```py
cr.sources() # returns a DataFrame
```
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90723578/167237471-51ad543b-9422-4285-a35f-72562c6431bc.png">

> You'll get a DataFrame with basic info on all the sources. The index, `Name` is the nickname with which you'll refer to the dataset moving forward.

<br>

To examine a source, pass the name of the dataset to `sources()`. This will make an api request to get all of its metadata.

<!-- But first, please declare your [App Token](#getting_token). Without it, you'll get warnings and throttling. -->

<!-- ```py -->
<!-- cr.set_token('XXXXXXXXXX') -->
<!-- ``` -->

Let's see the details on `crime_vs_incarceration` rate. All the info below is coming from Socrata's api.

```py
cr.sources('crime_vs_incarceration') 
```

Total Crime Rate vs Incarceration Rate Chart
https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.colorado.gov/ae3x-wvn9 

Total Crime includes: Violent crimes- Murder and non-negligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Property
crimes - Burglary, larceny/theft, and motor vehicle theft. National or
state offense totals are based on data from all reporting agencies and
estimates for unreported areas. Rates are the number of reported
offenses per 100,000 population. These figures are based on end of
calendar year populations.

Rows:    31
Cols:    9
Period:  1982 to 2012

COLUMNS:
-------
Year
  Field:  year
  Type:   text
  Null:   -
  Count:  31

Population
  Field:  population
  Type:   number
  Null:   -
  Count:  31
  Min:    3,045,000
  Max:    5,187,582

Here's what you'll see for text/categorical columns...

```text
Race
  Field:  race
  Type:   text
  Null:   30
  Count:  209,241
  ITEMS:
     White  (164,446)
     Black  (39,467)
     Asian/Pacific Islander  (2,236)
     Unknown  (1,889)
     American Indian/Alaskan Native  (1,203)
```

# 

Now we'll load some data

```py
cr.load('arrest_demographics')
```

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90723578/167092481-f535265f-8cce-49d7-80e9-318c598d44b9.png">

Returns 5-row preview by default, because some datasets have several **million** rows. To get the full dataset:

```py
cr.load('arrest_demographics', full=True)
```
<img width="738" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90723578/167093267-194b382a-ff8c-4a74-ba9f-7bb8e54ac456.png">

#

### Get more info on a source
Return dictionary with full metadata
```py
cr.metadata('dataset_name')
```
Return dataframe with metrics on each column
```py
cr.columns('dataset_name')
```

#

### Caching
> Any dataset loaded fully (by passing `full=True`) will be stored in memory, regardless of whether you've assigned it to a variable. Next time you load it, you'll receive a new copy (not a reference) of the data.

For example, if you run this at the top of your notebook...
```py
cr.load('arrest_demographics', full=True)
```
Now, elsewhere in your notebook...

EACH of these 3 lines will return the same thing: a COPY of the full dataset, returned instantly
```py
# Shorthand to fetch straight from the cache. Returns empty df if none are found in cache
cr.df('arrest_demographics')
```
```py
cr.load('arrest_demographics', full=True)
```
```py
cr.load('arrest_demographics')
```

#

### Add/Modify Sources
> First, select a dataset on [OpenDataNetwork](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/) and hit "View API". If you're brought to an API page [like this one](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.colorado.gov/4ykn-tg5h), (not all datasets have one), locate the "Dataset Identifier" on top-right side of page. Use that as `id`. For `base_url`, use the section of the url that comes after `/foundry/`.
```py
cr.add_source("crime_rates", "mb89-xnkg", "data.colorado.gov")
```
> You can pass any additional values as keyword arguments. Valid ones include `rows`, `full_name`, `web_url`, `from_year`, `to_year`, `location`, `type`, and `topic`.

To restore the original list of sources, use:
```py
cr.reset_sources()
```

Clear sources; start with a blank slate
```py
cr.clear_sources()
```

### No proper documentation yet. View the [source code](https://github.com/ryayoung/crime/tree/main/src/crime) if needed.
#### If there's a dataset not yet listed in our pre-defined sources, you can use the [`sodapy`](https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy) API wrapper to retrieve it manually.

## Getting your App Token

> Not required, but without one, you'll get warnings and be subject to "strict throttling limits" though it's unclear what those limits are.

### 1. Create a [Socrata account](https://data.colorado.gov/signup)

You just need an email and password.

> This takes you to the Colorado signup page, but your account will be universal for Socrata, so it doesn't matter.

**[Sign up](https://data.colorado.gov/signup)**

### 2. Create App Token

After verifying your email and entering your account, hit **Developer Settings** on the left side of the page.
